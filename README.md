# HoosOrganizing

This if our HooHacks repo!

The goal of this project was to create a google extension that allows students to upload their syllabi and receive an excel spreadsheet that lists all of 
their assignments for the semester. This spreadsheet is meant to be in chronological order and color coded according to class. It has many flaws but the 
concept is demonstrable from the code we have. 

This was the version that was developed exclusively in the 24 hours we had to work with at HooHacks.
